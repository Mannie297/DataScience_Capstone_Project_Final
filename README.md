Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This report shows the methodology, exploratory data analysis and predictive models used to determine if a launch will be successful or not.

Summary of methodologies
  • Data collection using Space X API
  • Data wrangling
  • Exploratory data analysis and visualization
  • Interactive visual analytics
  • Predictive analysis using various classification models.

Summary of all results
  • Exploratory data analytics result
  • Interactive dashboard
